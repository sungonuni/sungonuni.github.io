I'm a second-year Ph.D student of [Efficient Computing Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/eh-p) in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr), advised by Prof. Eunhyeok Park. Before joining POSTECH, I completed my B.S. in Department of Computer Science & Engineering in [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr).

I'm currently focusing on Efficient AI, particularly in enhancing **Memory Efficiency** and **Computation Acceleration** during model **training** and **inference** of various models (Vision, LLM, Video Generation, etc.) via **Quantization** and **Low-rank Approximation**.
