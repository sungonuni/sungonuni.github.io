I'm interested in model compression, particularly in enhancing memory efficiency and acceleration of AI through quantization. My recent research focuses on low-precision training and fine-tuning, which aims to achieve acceleration, memory reduction, and performance maximization during training. I currently focus on CUDA kernel optimization.
